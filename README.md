Project: Rock-Paper-Scissor

About: Created a GUI to play the game Rock-Paper-Scissor on the web browser.

This is my first web broswer based game that I have created using guidance from the Odin Project and freecodecamp.org Youtube's channel.

In this project, I have learnt alot about creating a page layout with html, decorating and positioning the divs using css, and creating functional buttons with updated scores output with javascript. 

Thank you for visiting my project.
